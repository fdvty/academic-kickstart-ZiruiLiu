Hi! I am a first-year PhD student in [EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Bin Cui](http://net.pku.edu.cn/~cuibin/) and [Prof. Tong Yang](http://net.pku.edu.cn/~yangtong/). My research interests lie in Computer Networks and Data Streams.
I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science from [Yuanpei College](https://yuanpei.pku.edu.cn), Peking University in 2021.

<!-- My research interests lie in the general area of Networks and Database. I find it excited to design and polish new data structures & algorithms. I'm also interested in other areas of computer science, for example, graphics and rendering. -->
<!-- Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have new ideas and need helper :) -->

My name written in Chinese is 刘子瑞. 
<!-- My research interests lie in the general area of Network Measurement, Data Stream Processing and P2P Network Broadcasting. I also have a keen interest in Ray Tracing Rendering.  -->

<!-- For the time being, I am looking for a research opportunity in the next summer. Please contact me if you are interested.  -->
