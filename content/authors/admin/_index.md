Hi! I am a senior year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science in Peking University, China. Currently, I am working with [Prof. Bin Cui](http://net.pku.edu.cn/~cuibin/) and [Prof. Tong Yang](http://net.pku.edu.cn/~yangtong/) on some projects related to Data Structure, Network Measurement, and Machine Learning. 

My research interests lie in the general area of Networks and Database. I find it excited to design and polish new data structures & algorithms. I'm also interested in other areas of computer science, for example, graphics and rendering.
